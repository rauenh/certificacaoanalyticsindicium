This is a repository created for the Analytics Engineering certification by Indicium Academy and Lighthouse Program. In this project we have to create a conceptual model (Kimball's Star Schema) based on AdventureWorks ERP Model, create a DW (using Google Big Query) and modeling the tables using DBT Core. Then, a data vizualization was created using PowerBi, aiming to answer some core business questions. 


### Using the starter project
- Install the virtualenv with `python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment`
- Activate the venv
- Run `pip install dbt-core`
- Install `pip install dbt-bigquery`
- Run `dbt deps`
  
Try running the following commands:
- dbt run
- dbt test
